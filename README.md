## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Ruby](https://rvm.io/) = v3.0.2
- [Rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) (Recommended)

To get started, first, clone this project by using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/mariordgez/hello-rails-back-end
```

### Installaion

Before launching the application, you will need to run a few commands in this order, line by line:</br>

```
yarn install or npm install
bundle install
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

Alternatively you can run `rails db:setup` instead of the last three commands.

Then launch the application with:</br>

`rails s` (Short for `rails server`) you wil see something like this:

```
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.1.4.1 application starting in development
=> Run `bin/rails server --help` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Puma version: 5.5.2 (ruby 3.0.2-p107) ("Zawgyi")
*  Min threads: 5
*  Max threads: 5
*  Environment: development
*          PID: 4225
* Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000
* Listening on http://[::1]:4000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

Use one of the two links to open the application. Once the application is running, click the random button to get a random message.

## API Usage

Api to get a random message:

| Name      | Endpoint      | Method | Header                           |
| --------- | ------------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Greetings | /v1/greetings | GET    | { "Accept": "application/json" } |

### Using API with a React App

To test the api you can use this React app [hello-react-front-end](https://github.com/mariordgez/hello-react-front-end).</br>
You will need to launch both applications at the same time, instructions on how to use the react app are in the README file.
